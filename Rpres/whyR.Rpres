Reproducible research
========================================================

- Possibility to inspect code
- Given acces to data, analysis can easily be re-run
- Accountability
- In contrast, it's hard to document what you did in point-and-click software

R is open source
========================================================
**Open source**  
- Its free
- Available to everyone
- The code is open to everyone

***
**Closed source**  
- Expensive license
- Not affordable by everyone
- Code is a black box
