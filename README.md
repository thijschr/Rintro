Introductory course to R for scientists without coding experience
=================================================================

This is a repository for a short introductory course in R. The course is 
meant to provide biologists/ecologists, without training in scripting or 
coding, the basic background needed in order to be able to do analyses in 
R on their own. The course was developed as an in-group, two-day course 
for the Geo-Ecology research groups (http://www.nhm.uio.no/english/research/groups/geco/) 
at the Natural History Museum in Oslo.

The course consists of five parts:
1) Why R?  
2) Introduction to RStudio  
3) Help and package installation  
4) Data structures/types in R  
5) Intro to programming structures in R (loops, if-else, functions)  

The presentations are R presentations made in RStudio, which are exported 
to html5 files that can be opened in Firefox, Chrome or Safari.
